      <description>Hi, my name is Tasin Ishmam. I&amp;rsquo;m from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering at BUET. My interests are in backend Web Development, Mobile Application Development &amp;amp; Machine Learning. I&amp;rsquo;m currently engaged in a research project which applies deep learning in object detection for Autonomous Vehicles.
In my spare time, I like to travel and take photographs. I also love books, film and podcasts.</description>
