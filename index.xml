      <description>print(&amp;#34;Hello Internet&amp;#34;) Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. This blog about me and my passions. I&amp;rsquo;l talk about technology, software development, machine learning, academia and other topics I find interesting.
So, it only makes sense to start by saying how this site came to life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;m a child of the internet, I grew up reading all sorts of interesting things on other people&amp;rsquo;s website.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Tasin Ishmam. I&amp;rsquo;m from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering at BUET. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in software development, machine learning &amp;amp; AI. I&amp;rsquo;m currently engaged in a research project which applies deep learning in object detection for Autonomous Vehicles.
In my spare time, I like to travel and take photographs. I also love reading, film and podcasts. You can find my photography on instagram and find what I&amp;rsquo;m reading on Goodreads.</description>
