      <description>There is a torrent of misinformation on the internet about the disease itself, the extent of the infection and government actions taken. As a community if we are not responsible in the information we share, we risk doing more harm than good. In order to get accurate information, we need to use reliable sources and fact-check all information.
With that in mind, this is a curated list of information sources to get one up to date on the COVID-19 situation, both locally and globally.</description>

      <description>print(&amp;#34;Hello Internet&amp;#34;) Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. This blog is about me and my passions. I&amp;rsquo;l talk about technology, software development, machine learning, academia and other topics I find interesting.
So, it only makes sense to start by saying how this site came to life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. When I was a child I was a prolific poster in a lot of online communities, forums and review sites.</description>
