<p><img src="https://tasinishmam.com/images/coronainbangladesh/header.png#center" alt="Banner" /></p>

<p>Last month we launched our website <a href="https://coronainbangladesh.com/">coronainbangladesh</a>. The response was pretty great. In the span of a month, we&rsquo;ve received over 50,000 visitors, <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/toggle/news/mythbuster-circulating-accurate-information-regarding-coronavirus-through-games-1887382">news coverage</a> and an acknowledgemet in the official <a href="https://corona.gov.bd/websites">government website</a>. However, having such a high amount of traffic comes with it&rsquo;s own set of challenges. I&rsquo;ve had previous experience developing production systems, but those were mainly Bots, Business integrations and CMS sites which don&rsquo;t receive a fraction of the traffic.</p>

<p>This article is a series of lessons I learnt throughout the development, updates and maintainance of coronainbangladesh. While reading, do keep in mind this guide is meant for novices and is written by one.<br />
So let&rsquo;s begin</p>

<h5 id="lesson-1-use-a-platform-as-a-service">Lesson 1 - Use a Platform as a Service</h5>

<p><img src="https://tasinishmam.com/images/coronainbangladesh/paas.png#center" alt="image" />
<div align="center">
  <font size="-4"> <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/">Image Source</a> </font>
</div>
If you&rsquo;re a beginner and don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the best way to get your code into a live production server, using a PaaS offering like <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a> will make things  <em>much</em> easier. These platforms are &ldquo;fully managed&rdquo;  meaning they do much of the heavy lifting for you. They come built in with features like</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplified deployments - Deploy with just one command and with zero downtime</li>
<li>Automatic scaling - Platform starts and closes new instances on the fly depending on traffic</li>
<li>Live staging server - Test your code in a live &ldquo;production&rdquo; environment before serving to the the pubic</li>
</ul>

<p>Now PaaS aren&rsquo;t a silver bullet, they do have their own set of problems. They usually cost more and aren&rsquo;t as easily customizable as a conventionnal VM. You sometimes have to write code in your application specific to the PaaS you&rsquo;re using. However, they can serve as a really useful set of training wheels when you&rsquo;re still learning the ropes.</p>

<h5 id="lesson-2-code-like-you-re-being-attacked-because-you-probably-are">Lesson 2 - Code like you&rsquo;re being attacked (because you probably are)</h5>

<p>We had our first DDos attack launched against us on day 5. I have no idea why anyone would want to attack something as benign as a our website, but they did. The chances of your website being attacked or exploited increases with the amount of traffic it receives. So security should be a first priority from the very beginning of development, not as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Make sure you do the basics - Securing your API endpoints, using SSL, hashing all Passwords, turning on CORS etc. You can find great framework specific security best practises all over the internet. Go through them before going into production.
We followed <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html">this checklist</a> on the express official website.</p>

<h5 id="lesson-3-constantly-monitor-your-server-resources">Lesson 3 - Constantly monitor your server resources</h5>

<p>Keep an eye out for how much Memory, CPU, Bandwidth your system is consuming. These metrics are an important indicator of the overall health of your system. Anomalies in any of these can be due to bugs, memory leaks or other performance issues. This can also give you an idea about resource utilization and help you decide to scale up or down a specific resouce. If you&rsquo;re using some fancy cloud service (Remember Lesson 1?), then a lot of these monitoring tools should come built in.</p>

<p>Additionally, make sure to clean up resources you&rsquo;re not using or you might find a nasty surprise waiting for you in your monthly bill. In our case, I made this totally stupid move where I forgot to disconnect from the database when my process instance was terminating. This resulted in about 300 concurrent connections to our database server just from localhost&hellip;.<em>yikes</em></p>

<h5 id="lesson-4-keep-the-scope-of-your-project-in-mind">Lesson 4 - Keep the scope of your project in mind</h5>

<p>Decision you make should always consider the scope and scale of your project. Just because something make&rsquo;s sense for Amazon does not mean it will also make sense for you. There is no one size fits all solution and over engineering is a genuine problem.</p>

<p>In our case, when we needed to add a cache to our server, we sort of unanimously decided we should use redis. This was simply because that&rsquo;s what we all read we should use from the internet. However, the absolute <em>minimum</em> sized configuration of redis on our cloud provider was about 100 times larger than we needed and costed more than our server and database combined. It was ridiculous, we could  fit our <em>entire</em> database on the redis server 100 times over and have no problem. Finally after rolling with redis for a few days, we decided to ditch it completely and just use a super simple in-memory caching library from npm. This worked perfectly, and it was <em>free</em>.</p>

<h5 id="lesson-5-run-a-lot-of-tests">Lesson 5 - Run a lot of Tests</h5>

<p><strong>Confession</strong>: I don&rsquo;t like writing tests. It&rsquo;s painstaking, repetetive and utterly boring. So I didn&rsquo;t write any tests when we launched our website. And&hellip;. I got screwed. Weird bugs were popping up, dependencies were breaking and all of these problems expressed themselves in the most unsuspecting of ways. The source of the bug is never in the first place you look. I had to spend hours chasing down trivial issues that would have been immidiately apparent if I had a comprehensive test suite.</p>

<p>I understand you&rsquo;re working with limited time and resources. But what you must realized is, writing tests actually saves you time in the long run. It&rsquo;s an investment that ends up paying massive dividends. But if you really don&rsquo;t have time to write a comprehensive test suite,  prioritize and start with API (Component) testing. This is the easiest way to write and provides more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like <a href="https://blog.postman.com/writing-tests-in-postman//">Postman</a>).</p>

<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>

<p>People learn best from experience. In that sense, this whole project has been a wonderful learning experience. Want to become a better developer? Go out there, make beautiful random things, see them break and then fix them. Trust me, that&rsquo;s the way your learning will have the most impact.</p>
