      <description>Last month we launched our website coronainbangladesh. In the span of a month, we&amp;rsquo;ve received over 50,000 visitors, news coverage and an acknowledgemet in the official Bangladesh Government website. However, having such a high amount of traffic comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own set of challenges. I&amp;rsquo;ve had previous experience developing production systems, but those were mainly Bots, Business integrations and CMS sites which don&amp;rsquo;t receive a fraction of the traffic this had.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the launch of our website, coronainbangladesh.com.
The objective behind this website was to increase awareness and present reliable infomration about the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Bangladesh. Everything you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak, in one place.
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has rapidly turned into a pandemic. Ever since breaking out in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China, it has spread to many countries of the world.</description>

      <description>print(&amp;#34;Hello Internet&amp;#34;) Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. This blog is about me and my passions. I&amp;rsquo;l talk about technology, software development, machine learning, academia and other topics I find interesting.
So, it only makes sense to start by saying how this site came to life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting a blog for a while now. When I was a child I was a prolific poster in a lot of online communities, forums and review sites.</description>
