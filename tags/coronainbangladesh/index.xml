      <description>Last month we launched our website coronainbangladesh. In the span of a month, we&amp;rsquo;ve received over 50,000 visitors, news coverage and an acknowledgemet in the official government website. However, having such a high amount of traffic comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own set of challenges. I&amp;rsquo;ve had previous experience developing production systems, but those were mainly Bots, Business integrations and CMS sites which don&amp;rsquo;t receive a fraction of this traffic.
This article is a series of lessons I learnt throughout the development, updates and maintainance of coronainbangladesh.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the launch of our website, coronainbangladesh.com.
The objective behind this website was to increase awareness and present reliable infomration about the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Bangladesh. Everything you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak, in one place.
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has rapidly turned into a pandemic. Ever since breaking out in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China, it has spread to many countries of the world.</description>

      <description>There is a torrent of misinformation on the internet about the disease itself, the extent of the infection and government actions taken. As a community if we are not responsible in the information we share, we risk doing more harm than good. In order to get accurate information, we need to use reliable sources and fact-check all information.
With that in mind, this is a curated list of information sources to get one up to date on the COVID-19 situation, both locally and globally.</description>
