      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished Google&amp;rsquo;s coding challenge, Foobar. This has honestly been a really fun programming game, and I wanted to share my experience!
What is it? Foobar is a invite only coding challenge hosted by google. The prize for completing? A chance to be recruited. Once you pass a certain level, you have the option to submit your solutions and personal info to a google recruiter. Getting an interview isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed however and not everyone gets a response from the recruiters.</description>
