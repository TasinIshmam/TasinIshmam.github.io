      <description>Last month we launched our website coronainbangladesh. In the span of a month, we&amp;rsquo;ve received over 50,000 visitors, news coverage and an acknowledgemet in the official government website. However, having such a high amount of traffic comes with it&amp;rsquo;s own set of challenges. I&amp;rsquo;ve had previous experience developing production systems, but those were mainly Bots, Business integrations and CMS sites which don&amp;rsquo;t receive a fraction of this traffic.
This article is a series of lessons I learnt throughout the development, updates and maintainance of coronainbangladesh.</description>
